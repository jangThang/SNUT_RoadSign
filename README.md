## About Repository
<!--Wirte one paragraph of project description -->  
This is a program that helps you find your way on SeoulTech campus.

## Overview
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
&nbsp; **'Seoul University of Science and Technology'** has a campus site of **520,000ãŽ¡**. It is the 5th largest university in Seoul. There are also 45 buildings, and although I am a graduate, there are many buildings that I do not know.

&nbsp; In addition, maps and signs within the school are lacking, and visibility is poor, making it difficult to navigate. The SNUT RoadSign project was undertaken to solve these difficulties.
